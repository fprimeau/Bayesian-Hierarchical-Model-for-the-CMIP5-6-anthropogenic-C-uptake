# Inference for Stan model: cmip_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(20000,20000,20000,20000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 80000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (2.0, 1.1, 0.98, 2.9) seconds, 7.0 seconds total
# Sampling took (187, 19, 16, 169) seconds, 6.5 minutes total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
